Academic integrity is at the heart of all higher education philosophies. Adhering to academic integrity policies ensures that you provide yourself with the best education possible. Maintaining academic integrity assures you receive the credit you deserve for your ideas. As us students create code for assignments and projects, we often reference internet sources. However, don't copy and paste others code as your own. It will not help you come exam time and you will likely not be able to explain it if prompted to defend the code you plagiarized.
